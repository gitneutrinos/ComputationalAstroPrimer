\section{Create a git repository}
For this exercise, we will be using github. Bitbucket and github provide essentially the same functionality, but github currently has some nice third-party tools that we will use. First, let's create a repository. Log into your github account (or create one).
\begin{enumerate}
\item Click the green ``New'' button on the top left of the home screen
\item Decide on a repository name and make the repository public (some tools are only made available to public repositories).
\item It is always good to have a license. I always use GNU GPLv3 because it does not allow others to take your public code and distribute it without the source.
\item Click ``Create Repository''
\end{enumerate}
